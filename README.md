## Rules for the To-do assignment

* Make a to do list webpage where people can add tasks to create a list of things to do. Add an option for users to indicate a task is done. Use jQuery to remove the task from the "to do" list. Make sure to identify specific behaviors your program should demonstrate, and create specifications with example input and output.

## Methodology

### _The following specs are included in the program:_

* Get input via form.
    input: <list item>
    output: <list item>

* Add item to list (array).

* Show item list to user.
    output: <item>

* Add radio called 'completed' to form.

* Activate radio (strike through string element).

* Add kill box.

* Activate kill box (eliminate string element with splice();).

* Create UI.

* Refactor code.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Download the files from the repository into appropriately named directories.
* Open the files with the browser of your choice.

## Known Bugs

_There are no known issues at this time. However, the program does not catch non-number input._
